# kirby-accordion-block

This is a [custom block plugin](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/blocks) for [Kirby CMS](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby). It is used to add a custom accordion block that uses semantic HTML and Bootstrap 5 syntax. 

Every accordion can also output with a valid FAQ-Schema.

Thanks for inspiration @kiah
